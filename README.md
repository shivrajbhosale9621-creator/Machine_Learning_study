# **My Machine Learning Journey**

Welcome to my Machine Learning repository\! This collection of Jupyter notebooks serves as a portfolio of my journey through the fundamental concepts of data science and machine learning. Each notebook tackles a specific topic, from data preprocessing and feature selection to building and evaluating various models.

## **About This Repository**

This project is a practical application of the skills I've learned in machine learning. It includes end-to-end examples of model development, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation for both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks.

## **üìÇ Repository Structure**

The repository is organized to be clean and easy to navigate:

* **/notebooks**: Contains all the Jupyter notebooks, named according to the topic they cover.  
* **/saved\_models**: Contains serialized (saved) models, such as .joblib files, that were trained in the notebooks.  
* **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the repository.

## **üõ†Ô∏è Core Concepts Covered**

This portfolio demonstrates proficiency in a wide range of machine learning techniques and libraries, including:

#### **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**

* **Feature Selection**: Using methods like Variance Threshold and Information Gain to select relevant features.  
* **Dimensionality Reduction**: Applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of features while retaining information.  
* **Data Scaling**: Using StandardScaler for normalizing data.

#### **Supervised Learning**

* **Regression**:  
  * Building a **Linear Regression** model from scratch to predict housing prices (California Housing dataset).  
  * Evaluating model performance with R¬≤ score and Mean Squared Error (MSE).  
* **Classification**:  
  * Implementing **Decision Trees** and **Logistic Regression** for classification tasks.  
  * Evaluating models using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and visualizing results with ROC/AUC curves and Confusion Matrices.

#### **Unsupervised Learning**

* **Clustering**:  
  * Applying **K-Means Clustering** to segment data (e.g., Mall Customers).  
  * Using **Hierarchical Clustering** and visualizing clusters with **Dendrograms**.  
  * Evaluating cluster quality with the **Silhouette Score**.

#### **Model Enhancement & Deployment**

* **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing model performance using **GridSearchCV** to find the best parameters.  
* **Model Persistence**: Saving and loading trained models using joblib for future use.
